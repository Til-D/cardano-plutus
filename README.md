# Notes and Snippets from Plutus Pioneer Program, Cohort 3

# MacOS Setup for Plutus Pioneer Program
Since there is a plethora of (at times outdated) installation guides out there, here is what worked for me running:
- macOS Monterey, v12.0.1
- processor: 2.3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7
- memory: 16 GB 3733 MHz LPDDR4X

I mostly followed the resource from [https://docs.plutus-community.com](https://docs.plutus-community.com/docs/setup/MacOS.html) with a few little tweaks.

## Setup
1 - Install Nix
	sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume
